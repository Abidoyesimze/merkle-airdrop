README for Merkle Airdrop Project
Overview
This project enables a token airdrop using a Merkle tree. The smart contract (MerkleAirdrop.sol) ensures that users can only claim their airdrop once by verifying a Merkle proof. A merkle.js script helps generate Merkle trees, roots, and proofs for the airdrop recipients.

Prerequisites
Node.js (v14.x or above)
npm or yarn
Hardhat for Solidity development and deployment
A web3 wallet like MetaMask for interacting with the smart contract
An Infura or Alchemy account for connecting to an Ethereum testnet
Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/merkle-airdrop.git
cd merkle-airdrop
2. Install Dependencies
You need to install the required dependencies for both the smart contract and the Merkle tree generation script.

bash
Copy code
npm install
This will install dependencies such as openzeppelin-solidity (for contracts), keccak256, merkletreejs, and others.

Running the merkle.js Script
The merkle.js script is used to generate the Merkle root and Merkle proofs for each user in the airdrop.

1. Input Airdrop Data
Create a file named airdrop.json in the root directory. The file should contain a list of airdrop recipients and the amount of tokens they are eligible to claim. Example:

json
Copy code
[
  { "address": "0x123...", "amount": 1000 },
  { "address": "0x456...", "amount": 500 }
]
2. Run the Script
The script generates the Merkle tree and outputs the root and proof for each user.

bash
Copy code
node scripts/merkle.js
The output will display the Merkle root and a JSON object with each recipient's Merkle proof.

Merkle root: Copy this root and use it to deploy the smart contract.
Proofs: Each user will have their own proof, which they will use when claiming their airdrop.
Deploying the MerkleAirdrop Contract
You can deploy the MerkleAirdrop.sol contract using Hardhat.

1. Configure Hardhat
Ensure that your hardhat.config.js contains the configuration for the network you want to deploy to (e.g., a testnet like Rinkeby or Goerli).

Example configuration in hardhat.config.js:

javascript
Copy code
require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle");

module.exports = {
  networks: {
    rinkeby: {
      url: process.env.INFURA_API_URL, // Set your Infura/Alchemy URL
      accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY] // Set your private key
    }
  },
  solidity: "0.8.0",
};
Make sure to set the environment variables INFURA_API_URL and PRIVATE_KEY in your .env file:

bash
Copy code
INFURA_API_URL=https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
2. Deploy the Contract
To deploy the MerkleAirdrop contract, first compile it:

bash
Copy code
npx hardhat compile
Then run the deployment script. Replace TOKEN_ADDRESS with your ERC20 token address and MERKLE_ROOT with the root generated by merkle.js:

bash
Copy code
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby
Example deployment script (scripts/deploy.js):

javascript
Copy code
async function main() {
  const tokenAddress = "0xYourTokenAddressHere";
  const merkleRoot = "0xYourGeneratedMerkleRootHere";

  const Airdrop = await ethers.getContractFactory("MerkleAirdrop");
  const airdrop = await Airdrop.deploy(tokenAddress, merkleRoot);

  await airdrop.deployed();

  console.log("Airdrop deployed to:", airdrop.address);
}

main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
Generating Proofs for Claiming the Airdrop
Once the contract is deployed, users can claim their tokens by providing a valid Merkle proof. The merkle.js script generates the proof as shown earlier. Each user should receive their proof and claim it by interacting with the smart contract.

1. Provide the Proof
To claim the tokens, users need to call the claimAirdrop function on the MerkleAirdrop contract and provide:

Their address
The amount of tokens they're eligible to claim
A valid Merkle proof
Users can interact with the contract using tools like Etherscan or web3.js, or they can build a simple frontend to facilitate claims.
